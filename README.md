## Overview
A simple React app to display a timeline with a series of dates


- How long you spent on the assignment.
-- ~3 hours

- What you like about your implementation.
-- Simplicity of the code. Modularization of the Timeline and the Events being displayed.

- What you would change if you were going to do it again.
--  Would improve the way events are being displayed. The dates being overflowed are not rendering correctly when scrolling through the timeline. I would improve the way events are being disaplyed. Also maybe separate the dates by paginating by month to avoid a bery big timeline being displayed.

* How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that.
-- I used as inspiration Gantt Chart, a chart that I normally use during the sprints to track Jira tickets and estimate how long tasks will last

* How you would test this if you had more time.
-- I would properly write unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library to make sure it is covering all scenarios.
